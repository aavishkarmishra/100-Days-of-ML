# 100-Days-of-ML

Joined udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) course and this repository is to keep my projects and records of this course.

## Naive Bayes

>It is classification algorithm which the order of objects doesn't matter.

>>Using this algorithm I have performed a mini project  
>>[Naive Bayes](/naive_bayes/nb_author_id.py) using **sklearn.naive_bayes** and got **accuracy of 97.042%**.

### Output of Naive Bayes

## Support Vector Machine  

>It is another classification algorithm . This algorithm **is much slower than**  
>**Naive Bayes** but we can improve speed by reducing the training data size
>but this will decreases the accuracy.

>>Using this algorithm I have performed a mini project  
>>[SVM](/svm/svm_author_id.py) using **sklearn's svm** and got **accuracy of 99.345%**.

## Decision Trees

>It also a classification algorithm but it is also used for regression.  
>It have several parameters for tuning.  
>In decision trees there are some formula for calulating some of them  
>**Entropy** is the number of impurity or is equal to `sum of(-(pi*log(pi,2))`  
>**Information Gain** is equal to `Entropy(parent)-(weighted average)Entropy(chidlren)`  
> Decision Trees algorithm tries to **maximize the Information gain** and **minimize the Entropy**
>>Using this algorithm I have performed a mini project  
>>[decision_tree](/decision_tree/dt_author_id.py) using **sklearn's decision tree** and got **accuracy of %**.
